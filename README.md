# Sales-Strategy-and-Sneakers-Building-the-Adidas-Dashboard
This project dives into Adidas 2020–2021 sales data using Excel to uncover key trends: the most profitable cities, top-performing salespeople, and high-impact product categories. The result is an interactive dashboard that empowers everyone from marketing teams to executive leaders, to make smarter, data-driven decisions.
## Introduction
In this project, I explored Adidas’ U.S. sales data from 2020 to 2021 using Excel, uncovering valuable trends across cities, sales teams, and product categories.
What started as rows of raw data became a dynamic, interactive dashboard—built to help teams across the business, from marketing to leadership, make confident, data-backed decisions.
## Data Overview
The dataset contains comprehensive Adidas sales records across various regions, product, and retailers. Key fields include:
- Invoice Dates
- Region
- Product Categories
- Sales Methods
- Operating Margins
- Total Sales Values
  ## Data Source
  This dataset was sourced from Kaggle's Adidas Sales Dataset. It contains Adidas retail sales data from 2020–2021. It is meant for educational purposes only
  ## Objective
  The main objective of this dashboard was to explore Adidas' sales performance across the U.S., broken down by retailer, region, product category, and sales method. The goal: uncover growth opportunities and develop strategies to boost profitability. This involved several key steps, including:
- Data Cleaning
- Interactive Dashboards
- Feature Engineering
- Consistent Formatting & Branding
  ## Data Cleaning
  The process began by sourcing Adidas’ sales data from Kaggle. Next came data cleaning addressing the following:
  - Missing values
  - Correcting inconsistent formats
  - Eliminating duplicates
  - Standardizing product categories, I even added two new colunms really pertinent to this analysis, which are;
    - Month
    - Days of the week
  This step was essential to ensure the dataset was accurate, reliable, and ready for meaningful analysis
## Chart & Visualization
The dashboard include the following visuals, all designed with a consistent aesthetic using different shades of gray to align with the Adidas brand theme:

## Insights 
### Patterns in the data quickly began to surface—and they told a compelling story.
- Some product categories and regions consistently outshined the rest, signaling clear areas of strength for Adidas.
- Monthly sales trends revealed predictable spikes and dips, offering key insights for seasonal planning and targeted campaigns.
- A closer look at sales methods uncovered which channels drive the most revenue, while also pointing to areas where performance could be sharpened through optimization.
## What I Learnt 
### Beyond the insights, this project was a major step forward in my growth as a data analyst.
- I gained hands-on experience in cleaning and structuring messy, raw data, transforming it into something reliable and analysis-ready.
- I discovered the real power of slicers, and how they can turn a static report into an interactive tool.
- I also deepened my understanding of dashboard design—learning how consistency, clarity, and layout can elevate the impact of your visuals. Most importantly, I came to appreciate that Excel isn’t just a spreadsheet tool—it’s a surprisingly powerful (and even enjoyable) platform for serious data analysis and storytelling.
